this is a simple http server written in C that only handles 'localhost:port' use.
it doesn't have fancy things like hot-reloading, concurrency, or anything in that
category.

but it's really been a nice introduction to network programming and
defensive programming.

you can use it by writing 'make install' after copying this repository but i
wouldn't recommend it.
