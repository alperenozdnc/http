            these utility functions are used for centering single/multi line strings.
            they only support ascii characters at this point of time.

            at some point, you may need to center strings, may that be for readability,
            eye candy, or anything else, doesn't matter. centering a string is a solved
            problem and is deterministic in terms of the correct result. thus, these
            not-so-primitive-looking utilities had to be included in ezcli.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>clicenter_horiz()</code> centers a single/multi line string horizontally.</li>
            <li><code>clicenter_vert()</code> centers a single/multi line string vertically.</li>
            <li><code>clicenter_both()</code> centers a single/multi line string both vertically and horizontally.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

            <code>clicenter_vert()</code> does handle excess newlines at the start or end of your string.
            and so does <code>clicenter_both()</code>. in <code>clicenter_horiz()</code> your excess newlines
            must be assumed a design choice and are printed as-is.
        </p>

        <p>
            these utilities only support ascii characters and implicitly assume that 
            one visible character always equates to a single byte.
        </p>

        <p>
            the <code>window_s</code> struct (see <a href="/wininfo">ezcli/wininfo</a>) is just a struct that holds information about the bounds
            of the current terminal window. these utilities are currently only linux-supported.
            although, they don't do any heap allocation and don't return anything.
        </p>

        <p>
            in future revisions, the choice of the centering utilities being only desktop
            and not embedded might change, and in that case, keep in mind that you can always
            create an artificial <code>window_s</code> struct.
