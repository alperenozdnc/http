      <p>there are exactly four special options in ezcli:</p>

      <p>
        these are actually <q>phony</q> options - in a sense that they don't
        actually have an alias, (although requiring their corresponding special
        alias to be able to be recognized in an <code>opt_s</code> struct) - but
        these special <q>options</q> are still passable as context-aware
        behaviour containers, so you can still loosely define them as options.
      </p>
      <p>
        these options are not printed in help, so they don't require a
        <code>desc</code> field like all other options do.
      </p>

      <p>
        note: setting more than a single alias (the intended ones) to any of
        these special <q>options</q> will cause behaviour you don't necessarily
        want.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <section>
        <h3>non-option option (nonopt)</h3>
        <p>
          this is the behaviour that is executed when a token is not recognized
          as any normal option and isn't passed as argument to any option.
        </p>

        <p>
          for example, <code>/home</code> is the nonopt for
          <code>ls /home</code>.<br />
          <code>./src</code> is the nonopt for
          <code>grep -r "ezcli" ./src</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          for usage, set extern boolean <code>CLI_ALLOW_NONOPT</code> to
          <code>true</code>. if this flag is set to true and no nonopts are
          found, ezcli will throw an error.
        </p>

        <p>
          then, you should create an <code>opt_s</code> struct that has
          <code>CLI_NONOPT</code> as the only item in its
          <code>aliases</code> field.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>default option</h3>
        <p>
          this is the behaviour that is executed when your program receives no
          input (<code>argc = 1, argv = {cmd_name, NULL}</code>). if not
          defined, ezcli will print the default help option which is
          automatically generated.
        </p>

        <p>
          for usage, you should create an <code>opt_s</code> struct that has
          <code>CLI_DEFAULT_OPT</code> as the only item in its
          <code>aliases</code>
          field.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>common option</h3>
        <p>
          this is the behaviour that is executed before every successfully
          parsed option. this is useful for formatting, debugging, pretty
          printing, logging, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          for usage, you should create an <code>opt_s</code> struct that has
          <code>CLI_COMMON_OPT</code> as the only item in its
          <code>aliases</code>
          field.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>post-common option</h3>
        <p>
          this is the behaviour that is executed after every successfully parsed
          option. this is useful for formatting, debugging, pretty printing,
          logging, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          for usage, you should create an <code>opt_s</code> struct that has
          <code>CLI_POST_COMMON_OPT</code> as the only item in its
          <code>aliases</code> field.
